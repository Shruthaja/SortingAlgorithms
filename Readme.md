# Sorting Algorithms Visualization

Project Overview - This project implements various sorting algorithms and provides a graphical comparison of their performance on arrays of different sizes (10, 100, and 10,000 elements). The algorithms are executed through the app.py file, which generates visual representations of their efficiency.

The following sorting algorithms are included in this project:

1. Bubble Sort (bubblesort.py)
2. Heap Sort (heapsort.py)
3. Insertion Sort (insertionsort.py)
4. Merge Sort (mergesort.py)
5. Quick Sort (quicksort.py)
6. Selection Sort (selectionsort.py)
7. Three-Point Quick Sort (threepointquicksort.py)

# Files Included
1. app.py: Main application file that runs all sorting algorithms and generates graphical comparisons.
2. bubblesort.py: Implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm.
3. heapsort.py: Implementation of the Heap Sort algorithm.
4. insertionsort.py: Implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm.
5. mergesort.py: Implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm.
6. quicksort.py: Implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm.
7. selectionsort.py: Implementation of the Selection Sort algorithm.
8. threepointquicksort.py: Implementation of the Three-Point Quick Sort algorithm.

# How to Run the Project
i) Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
ii) Clone the repository or download the project files.
iii) Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
iv) Run the app.py file using the command:
```python3 app.py```

The application will execute all sorting algorithms on arrays of sizes 10, 100, and 10,000, and display the results graphically. The project provides a graphical representation of the sorting algorithms' performance, allowing users to easily compare their efficiency and execution time.

# Conclusion 
This project serves as a practical implementation of fundamental sorting algorithms, showcasing their performance differences through visualization. It's an excellent resource for understanding algorithm efficiency and behavior with varying data sizes.
